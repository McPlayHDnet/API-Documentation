description: A tutorial in how to use the API

# Getting Started

## Beta

This API is still under development and the layouts of the responses might change several times until the final release. All users during beta should know that the API might be unavailable at any point in time and structurally change spontaneously.

## Token

Certain requests will require you to provide a valid token linked to your Minecraft account. For now, these tokens can only be generated by requesting so on the [Discord](https://mcplayhd.net/discord) by opening a support ticket after being verified.

By requesting a page with authentication you need to add the query parameter **?token={token}** to any of your API requests.

## Abuse

Do not abuse our API.  
This also includes not using our API for getting UUID by player name and vice versa. Use the official [Mojang API](https://api.mojang.com/) for that.  
We are free to revoke your access to our API at any time if we think you are abusing our system.

## Rate limit

The rate limit is not a fixed value and can be changed on request with a valid reason.

### Default

The default rate limit is 60 requests in 60 seconds.

### Cost

By default, requests will cost 1 rate request. If an API request costs more or less there will be a warning below the corresponding API method documentation.

### Status

You can always view your current rate by calling the [**main page**](getting-started.md#main-page-and-api-info) with your token as a parameter.  
This action won't increase your rate.

{% api-method method="get" host="https://mcplayhd.net/api/" path="?token={token}" %}
{% api-method-summary %}
â€‹Main page & API info
{% endapi-method-summary %}

{% api-method-description %}
This is the main page of the API with a welcome/info message.  
If you provide your token, you can see your UUID, rank, rate-limit, rate-limit reset time and your current rate.
{% endapi-method-description %}

{% api-method-spec %}
{% api-method-request %}
{% api-method-query-parameters %}
{% api-method-parameter name="token" type="string" required=false %}
your authentication token
{% endapi-method-parameter %}
{% endapi-method-query-parameters %}
{% endapi-method-request %}

{% api-method-response %}
{% api-method-response-example httpCode=200 %}
{% api-method-response-example-description %}
data will be a message and if authenticated your API user info else null
{% endapi-method-response-example-description %}

```yaml
{
  "status" : 200,
  "path" : "<string - current path>",
  "timeStamp" : "<string - current time stamp>",
  "processingTime" : <long - time to process the action in ms>,
  "data" : {
    "message" : "<string - API information message>",
    "authenticated" : <boolean - true if you pass a valid token as query parameter>,
    "user" : { # will be null if you are not authenticated
      "uuid" : "<string - your Minecraft UUID>",
      "rank" : "<string - your API rank>",
      "rateLimit" : <int - your rate limit>,
      "rateLimitTimeMs" : <int - the time for your rate limit to reset>,
      "currentRate" : <int - your current request rate>
    }
  }
}
```
{% endapi-method-response-example %}
{% endapi-method-response %}
{% endapi-method-spec %}
{% endapi-method %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This action costs **0** rate requests.
{% endhint %}
